			<div class="desc"><h3>DALAI LAMA TEMPLE</h3>There is a reason why Dharamshala is famous for its monasteries. The place has the grandest and picturesque monasteries in India that have preserved the Buddhist and Tibetan culture after the Dalai Lama’s exile from Tibet. While there are other famous tourist attractions such as the Dharamshala cricket stadium, tea gardens, Kangra fort and rock temples of Masroor in and around Dharamshala, one can certainly not miss visiting the monasteries in Dharamshala.

				I would urge even the most unreligious souls to visit them for the aesthetic and cultural experience that they provide. </div>

			<div class="desc"><h3>HIDIMBA TEMPLE</h3>Hadimba Temple, which was constructed in the 16th century, is one of the best places to visit in Manali and is located amid a beautiful deodar forest on top of a hill in Manali. The temple holds great significance for the locals and also the tourists who frequently visit the pilgrim spot to seek blessings from Goddess Hadimba. The temple is dedicated to the Goddess Hadimba who was also the wife of the strongest of the Pandava brothers, Bhima. So, she was given the position of Goddess by the most powerful Goddess Durga, whose 10 centimeter footprint is preserved at the entrance of the temple.</div>

			<div class="desc"><h3>RIVERS OF HIMACHAL</h3>The surreal state of Himachal Pradesh boasts many rivers that run through its popular, lesser-known, and unexplored destinations, making an essential part of the landscape. The gurgling and forming rivers of Himachal truly make for its lifeline; it is through them many quench their thirst and earn their livelihoods, whereas for some these streams are the adventure they were looking for. The drainage system of Himachal Pradesh has five rivers - the Chandrabhaga or Chenab, the Sutlej, Ravi, Yamuna, and the Beas.  These are perennial rivers fed either by a glacier or rainfall.The two important rivers in Himachal Pradesh, the Yamuna and the Sutlej do not have their origin in the state. While the Yamuna rises in the Uttarkashi District of Uttarakhand, the Sutlej takes a difficult journey of crossing the Indo-Tibet border and flowing through the rugged terrains of Spiti to reach the state.
